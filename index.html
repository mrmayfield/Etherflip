		<h2><a class="green">About</a></h2>
		<p>Try your luck and gamble on an Ethereum dice roll in a <strong>provably-fair</strong> environment thanks to the power of the Ethereum blockchain.</p>
		<p>No sign-up, no user accounts, no deposits. Just dice.</p>

		<h2><a class="green" name="the_game">How to play</a></h2>
		<p>Take a chance! You are betting on the result of either a high or a low 100 sided dice roll. The result of the dice roll is either within a low roll range (1-50) or a high roll range (51-100).</p>
		<p>If the number you submit is within the result range (high or low); low range numbers are (1-50), high range numbers are (51-100) you are paid 1.98 to 1 instantly.</p>
		<p>If the number you submit is outside the result range you are not paid. Each roll takes at <em>least</em> 1 minute to complete.</p>
		<h2><a class="green" name="instructions">Instructions</a></h2>
		<p><strong>IMPORTANT PLEASE READ BEFORE PLAYING:</strong></p>
		<ol>
			<li><strong>To play you must first make sure you are currently synchronized to the latest block on the Ethereum blockchain, doing so otherwise could result in a loss of your original bet.</strong></li>
			<li>To place a bet, enter your bet size. The current minimum wager is 0.5 Ether. The current maximum wager is <span class="max-bet">2</span>  Ether. All units are in Ether.</li>
			<li>Any wager that exceeds the maximum bet will result in your wager being <strong>quietly refunded</strong>, <strong>voiding the play</strong> and excluding you from that betting round.</li>
			<li>Any wager that will result in >5% of the pool at risk, will result in that bet being <strong>voided</strong> and <strong>quietly refunded</strong>.</li>
			<li>Enter a lucky number between 1-50 (low) or 51-100 (high).</li>
			<li>A win will return your original amount plus profit, minus commission applied.</li>
			<li>Etheroll operates on a 2% commission, this is subtracted from the amount returned to the player in the case of a win.</li>
		</ol>
		<h3>Note:</h3>
		<p><strong>During our pre-alpha release phase, each betting round will only accept a maximum of 3 players per round. This is only a temporary measure, to primarily keep gas costs down for our users as we continue to optimize Etheroll.</strong></p>
		<p>If you are the 4th better of the round (submitting a late bet), you will be quietly refunded and your play will be voided.</p>
		<p>Each round takes up to 1 or 2 minutes, so be patient as each dice roll is in progress. Do not close your browser window if you are in the middle of a wagered dice roll. You may lose your funds with no chance for recovery. You have been warned.</p>
		<p>Be aware that when you are in a betting round, you will incur gas charges to participate whether you win or lose. Etheroll does not receive the gas you spend. Gas is used to maintain the Ethereum blockchain.</p>
		<h2><a class="green">Connect and play</a></h2>
		<p>Because Ethereum is still being heavily developed and the official Mist browser has not yet been publicly released, to play Etheroll currently you will need to:</p>
		<p class="green"><strong>Step 1:</strong></p>
		<p>If you would like to place bets, run your own Ethereum blockchain and connect to Etheroll with the following command:</p>
		<p>geth --rpc --rpccorsdomain="http://etheroll.com" --unlock="your_wallet_address"</p>
		<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>
		<p>If you would prefer just to watch some games without unlocking your account, to do so use:</p>
		<p>geth --rpc --rpccorsdomain="http://etheroll.com"</p>
		<p>However you will not be able to participate in the game until you unlock your account.</p>
		<p>If you have security concerns over unlocking your account, it might also be best to unlock an account with minimal funds.</p>
		<p class="green"><strong>Step 2:</strong></p>
		<p>You will be prompted to enter your password to unlock your account which will enable you to place bets and receive winnings from Etheroll. We never receive your password at anytime during your interaction with Etheroll.</p>
		<p class="green"><strong>Step 3</strong>:</p>
		<p>Once you have done this you can reload our website and you should see your wallet balance in the top right hand corner.</p>
		<p>During our pre-alpha release phase the maximum bet is <span class="max-bet"></span> Ether. Do not send more than <span class="max-bet">2</span> Ether. No refunds.</p>
		<p>If you land at the site and it says "Bet in progress" wait until a new round starts before submitting any bets.</p>

		<h2><a class="green" name="provably_fair">Provably Fair</a></h2>
		<p>Randomness is sourced from <a href="https://www.random.org/">Random.org</a> — which provides true randomness from atmospheric noise — via <a href="http://www.oraclize.it/">Oraclize.it</a></p>
		<p>Oraclize provides players with <a href="https://docs.oraclize.it/#tlsnotary-proof">TLSNotary proof</a> that the data Random.org returns to Etheroll has not been manipulated or changed in anyway since Etheroll initially requested the random number for the dice roll.</p>
		<p>The randomness Etheroll requests is an integer between 1-100 that is served to Etheroll by Random.org. The data it generates is a <a href="https://www.random.org/randomness/">random number</a> from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_noise">atmospheric noise</a> between 1-100 (<a href="https://www.random.org/integers/?num=1&min=1&max=100&col=1&base=10&format=plain&rnd=new">try it for yourself</a>).</p>
		<p>The call to Random.org to produce the random number is made only after all bets have been submitted, therefore the dice result is impossible for us, or you to know, prior to the submission of the bet.</p>
		<h2><a class="green" name="roll_in_progress">Die roll is in progress</a></h2>
		<p>If you see this upon entering Etheroll it means somebody is already in the middle of a die roll. There is a limited time where you can add to the bet, but after you will not be able to place any bets until the die roll in progress is complete. Each roll takes ~6-8 blocks. The duration of each roll is dependant upon the speed of the network in general.</p>
