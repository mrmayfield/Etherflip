<h2 class="green">Own a part of online gambling history</h2>
<p><a href="investors-register.html">Pre-register</a> your interest now before it is too late.</p>
<p>To continue funding our ambitious project of launching one of the 1st (2nd to be exact) ever decentralized gambling platforms, we are selling a small percentage of Etheroll during our Seed investment phase to investors who would like to be a part of the future of gambling online on top of the Ethereum blockchain. The investors from the Seed round form the distributed, autonomous company that is to become Etheroll. You will own a piece of the company in proportion to the amount of funds you send.</p>
<p>Our road-map includes a live launch within weeks, at a time when we will be 1 of only 2 gambling Ðapps in existence. We believe this will give us near 'first-mover advantage' and essentially 'institutionalize' Etheroll in the potentially $500m niche market that is to become Ethereum gambling.</p>
<p>We are only just getting started. Our road-map includes plans to build out other exciting games within the next 6-12 months. As an investor you will receive an investment pack with full details on our exact plans.</p>
<p>Investors will receive direct address dividends from the total profit of Ethereum on a quarterly basis in perpetuity, via the implementation of a smart-contract within Ethereum. No room for exploitation, corruption, the smart-contract will work exactly as it is written, allowing for a 'trust-less' investment environment in which the investor can simply trust the smart-contract will perform the duties exactly as it is written in code, each time, every time, forever.</p>
<p>The amount you receive will depend upon your stake in the company. Etheroll has a transparent, provably fair house-edge of 2%.</p>
<p>Our current 1 year target is to gain control of ~10% of the gambling market within Ethereum. From there, world domination.</p>
